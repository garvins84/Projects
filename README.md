Application 12 is a work in project Tic Tac Toe game. It is a C# program whose main goal is to be able to play against an AI that utilizes a minimax tree with alpha beta pruning. So far the game is functional, meaning that should I remove the automated playing loop a player could play against a randomized AI. In its current state, however, it is set to play itself (i.e. two random agents playing against each other) for several thousand iterations. Each game state is then saved into a file as a hash with special tokens. This is so that the contents of each game can be easily searched and populate a game tree. The next steps for this project will be to create a functional game tree, and apply pruning operations to yield the next move for an agent to take.
